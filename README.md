Upgraded the base game presented in class:

**Part1**- We added special items you can pickup:

Horse: Allows movement on mountains.
Boat: Allows you to cross water tiles.
Pickaxe: Breaks through mountains and turn them into grass.



**Part2:** Your character can only move to tiles designated as "floor tiles." Other tiles, like walls are not accessible.

Each left mouse click will move your character to a randomly selected valid floor tile.
