Upgrade the base game presented in class.

## Part 1:

Adding the following items to the map:

* Boat: Lets the player cross water.
* Goat: Allows the player to climb mountains.
* Pickaxe: Lets the player mine mountains, turning them into grass.

These items provide new ways to explore and overcome obstacles.

## Part 2:

Generating a random cave map, placing the player at a random starting position, and ensuring that the player is not "stuck" in a location where they can't escape, such as a small cave or surrounded by walls.

* BFS for Pathfinding: BFS is used to explore the map from the player's starting position to check how many tiles are reachable.
* Random Player Placement: If the player starts in a location where fewer than 100 tiles are reachable, a new random location is chosen until the condition is met.

Each left mouse click will move the character to a randomly selected valid floor tile.
